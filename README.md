# my-resum

Hello My name is Lyna Bentarzi , I am 21 years old. I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, with a specialization in Computer Systems (Systèmes Informatiques), earned under the LMD system in Algeria. Over the course of my three-year program, I built a solid academic foundation in algorithms (levels 1–3), C programming, computer architecture, operating systems, and applied mathematics (algebra, probability, and statistics). I also gained practical experience with structured programming (C), database design (SQL), MATLAB, and system-level concepts such as operating systems and compilers.
In my final year, I expanded my expertise to include XML, Java Swing (HCI), UML modeling, linear programming, mobile development with React Native, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity. My graduation project—a commercial partnership web platform developed with Laravel for Djezzy Telecom—was awarded high distinction, highlighting both its technical quality and practical relevance.
At present, I am preparing to begin a Master’s degree in Cyber Security .
I really want this job because I love Laravel so much and I can share with you my first big project I did with Djezzy Telecom.
I hope I can hear from you soon.
